      <h3>description</h3>
      <p>1930s. The period of the British Raj in India. A resident of the village of Analisan, “Isa”,
         decides to join the British-Indian army, which his older brother Sengolan, the leader of a 
         revolutionary detachment, tries to prevent. Despite many contradictions, Isa makes his choice.
          Having enlisted in the ranks of soldiers, he receives the nickname “Miller” - later he begins 
          to call himself “Captain Miller”. In one of the missions, together with his combatants, he is 
          forced to kill Indian freedom fighters, which makes him reconsider his goals. He returns to the 
          village and discovers that his older brother was also killed as a result of the armed conflict. 
          This opens his eyes, Isa changes sides and joins the Indian militia, helping his fellow 
        tribesmen kill the British. Another troublemaker is a six-hundred-year-old stone, which the British 
        government begins to hunt. “Miller” rushes to prevent this.
