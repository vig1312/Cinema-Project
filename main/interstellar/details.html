      <p><span>description:</span>Interstellar is a 2014 epic science fiction drama film directed by Christopher Nolan, who co-wrote it with his brother Jonathan.
        It stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, Michael Caine, and Matt Damon. Set in a dystopian
        future where Earth is suffering from catastrophic blight and famine,
        the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new home for humankind.
        The screenplay had its origins in a script Jonathan developed in 2007, and was originally set to be directed by Steven Spielberg.
        Theoretical physicist Kip Thorne was an executive producer and scientific consultant on the film, and wrote the tie-in book The Science
        of Interstellar.
        Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot it on 35 mm movie film in the Panavision anamorphic format and IMAX 70 mm. Filming began in
        late 2013 and took place in Alberta,
        Klaustur, and Los Angeles. Interstellar uses extensive practical and miniature effects,
        and the company DNEG created additional digital effects.
